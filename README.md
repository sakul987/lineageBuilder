This is supposed to be a script for my specific use case to build Lineage OS for my device.
It's designed to run inside an Ubuntu 22.04 LXC Container which only serves this one purpose and expects you to provide the proprietray blobs needed to build.
I plan on adding the option to include MicroG, but first I will have to finish the base script.
